Game introduction

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.


How to play:

* The user selects one character to start the game
* The player move left, right, up and down to avoid Enemies as well as collect gems.
* The score will increase by 10 each time the player reachs the river.
* The collected gem amount will be recorded.
* The score and gem aount will be reset to 0 if the player collides with an enemy.
* The user can press 'x' key to restart the game
